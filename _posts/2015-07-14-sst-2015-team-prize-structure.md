The point of the teams and prizes is to encourage the young people to participate, pay attention in the lessons, memorize verses, and blend. We can modify the point structure as SST goes along so as to make the teams' scores as close as possible (to keep it competitive and so no one is discouraged), and we can update the young people periodically throughout SST with hints about who is in the lead, but actual numbers will not be revealed until the very end when we have prizes.

**Disclaimer:** The point values below are arbitrary. We can adjust them as necessary as we go along, but we need to start somewhere so that we have some sense of how much to weigh verses against questions in the Bible Trivia game and the Saturday activities.

## Teams

> **Note to serving ones:**
Try to make the teams as balanced as possible. They should include brothers and sisters, young people and serving ones, varying ages and grades. Depending on the number of total registrants you may want to make 3 or 4 teams.

## Memory verses

### The Points and Prizes

Point-wise/prize-wise, the memory verses should be weighed more heavily in relation to other items/activities. We want the word of Christ to dwell richly in the young people, so we should let them know this at the beginning of the summer school of truth to encourage them to memorize the verses.

### The Rules

Every verse that is listed out in the booklet/outline given to the young people is eligible for points. Memory verses that are listed in the lessons can be worth slightly more than the ones that are in the 'More memory verses section.'

**Below is an example of possible points:**

1. **[Main memory verses](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GBy1zWufL_3OHsrSYUKWj04luBazWdy745gDc2z5BAo/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}** (57 total): 5 pts each
2. **[More memory verses](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kNDLEGSBS7DCaCjR8-tbaW38V-yi-889lOUWU7TSqL4/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}**: 3 pts each
3. Individual verse challenge: 100 pts if successful - 10 verses; serving one gives verse reference to young person one at at time, young person recites.

## Saturday Activities

> **Note to serving ones:**
Try to have the activities be team-based, and have some sort of point structure if possible. At the very least we will want to know which teams won which activities. We can convert the data/points afterward to balance out the scores.
