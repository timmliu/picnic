The teams and prizes are to encourage the young people to participate, pay attention in the lessons, memorize verses, and blend. We can modify the point structure as SST goes along so as to make the teams' scores as close as possible (to keep it competitive and so no one is discouraged), and we can update the young people periodically throughout SST with hints about who is in the lead, but actual numbers will not be revealed until the very end when we have prizes.

**Disclaimer:** The point values below are arbitrary. We can adjust them as necessary as we go along, but we need to start somewhere so that we have some sense of how much to weigh verses against questions in the Bible Trivia game and the Saturday activities.

<br>

## Teams

> **Note to serving ones:**
Try to make the teams as balanced as possible. They should include brothers and sisters, young people and serving ones, varying ages and grades. You can decide on  the number of teams, just keep in mind that having more teams increases participation in Bible Bowl, but is harder to balance and coordinate.

## Memory verses

### Rules

There will be three ways to earn points for memory verses:
1. **[Main memory verses](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GBy1zWufL_3OHsrSYUKWj04luBazWdy745gDc2z5BAo/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}** (24 total): worth more than verses in the *More memory verses* section.
2. **[More memory verses](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kNDLEGSBS7DCaCjR8-tbaW38V-yi-889lOUWU7TSqL4/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}** : worth less points than the *main* memory verses.
3. **Cumulative verse challenge**: (worth a lot of points) - Recite 10 out of 24 of the main verses word for word to Joseph, Fred, or Timm. The 12 verses will be selected by Joseph, Fred, or Timm when you decide to do the challenge. Must be recited word perfect without help. Young person may be asked to start over if he/she pauses for too long.

<br>

## Saturday Activities

> **Note to serving ones:**
Try to have the activities be team-based, and have some sort of point structure if possible. At the very least we will want to know which teams won which activities and how they compare to one another. We can convert the data/points afterward to balance out the scores.

<br>

## Bible bowl/bible trivia

> **Note to speaking brothers:**
You can aim for 3-5 questions per lesson, but feel free to write as many as you want, because we do need a lot of questions for Bible Bowl. Please keep the questions more objective and answerable such as (but not limited to) short answers/words/phrases or multiple choice.

### Timing:
2 sessions, 45 min each, on Saturdays before dinner

- 1st session: Lessons 1-5
- 2nd session: Lessons 6-12*

* Lesson 12 might not be included

### Rules

- Each team sits in 2 columns, one for junior high, one for high school.
- Only the person in front can answer the question, but you can telephone/whisper/pass the answer up to the front.
- To answer, you must stand up and be acknowledged and asked to answer by the panel. There will be judges in the back to determine who stood up first.
- If you blurt out the answer before you are asked, your turn will be skipped.
- We will ask alternating questions to the junior high, then the high school.
- After each question, rotate the line by sending the person in the front to the back, and everyone else moves up one seat.
- During bible bowl, participants may not look at any bibles/outlines/notes/cell phones/etc.

### Questions types

- Short answer
- Multiple choice
- True/false with explanation
- Verse reference
- Verse recite (word for word)
- Supporting verse (name a verse that proves ..)
- Fill in the blank

### Question point values
> This is still a work in progress, and may change later, but questions will likely be weighed easy, medium, and hard, with point values such as 2, 5, and 5 points.

## Prizes

> **Note to serving ones:**
1. Prizes for winning team
2. Prizes for first place verse memorization, 1 for brothers, 1 for sisters
